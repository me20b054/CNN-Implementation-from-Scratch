# CNN-Implementation-from-Scratc

Most of the time we don't know what mathematically happens inside the CNN network to extract features and maxpool the layers 
Above code is the the implementation of CNN Architecture with just numpy without using libraries like Pytorch and Tensorflow
I'm adding the training accuracy in the file
